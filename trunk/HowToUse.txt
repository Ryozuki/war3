Level up sound:(soundfiles are not used in vanilla teeworlds. But make a backup if you want?)

data/audio/vo_teefault_cry-02.wv

Xp_table:
You can put a file named "xp_table.war" into teeworlds/ .
This file is a txt file like the one with the mod to set xp required by each level.
If the file doesn't exist default xp_table is loaded.

Say /cmdlist for a list of command availabe in game

To use special abilities you need to bind a key:
Step 1 : Open the console
Step 2 : choose a key for example f
Step 3 : type "bind key say /ability" so for me it is : "bind f say /ability"
Step 4 : go pwn !
